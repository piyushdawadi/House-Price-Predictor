# House-Price-Predictor
In this project I have tried to predict the price of houses in certain areas using Machine Learning.
I have used Linear Regression algorithm to train the model.
This is not an end to end project and I have not built a Graphical User Interface to showcase the end project.
During the Feature Engineering phase, most of the time was spent on either filling in or imputing the missing data, so much of the oulier have not been removed.
I primarily created this model to learn the use of pipelines during the traning of the models.
